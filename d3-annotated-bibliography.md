### Mike Bostock: "Let's Make a Bar Chart"

([link][1])

The canonical D3 tutorial, introducing selections, the method-chaining style of
the D3 API, using a data join to create elements, mapping data to properties of
DOM nodes, and introducing scales to translate between the bounds of your data
and the bounds of the elements in the page.

Coming back to this tutorial after having read many other sources, I'm struck by
how much of D3's conceptual structure Bostock delivers here. Although, I know
that some of it flew right over my head the first time I worked through this
example:

> The data operator returns the update selection. The enter and exit selections
> hang off the update selection, so you can ignore them if you donâ€™t need to add
> or remove elements.

I found getting used to which selections you need to savee references to and
when one of the trickier bits of D3. But Bostock actually explains it pretty
clearly:

> Since method chaining can only be used to descend into the document hierarchy,
> use `var` to keep references to selections and go back up.

It's just that it doesn't stick until you've been confused by a few examples -
and start remembering which API methods return a new selection.

### Mike Bostock: "Let's Make a Bar Chart, II"

On to part two, which introduces basic SVG, loading data from external files,
and data structured as an array of objects instead of just an array of values.
Bostock also introduces the use of a `<g>` tag to wrap multiple visual elements
that need to be positioned together. But this is a little bit of a subtle
technique, because it involves positioning the group relative to the SVG and
then positioning its children _relative to the `<g>` tag_.

In the previous "Let's Make a Bar Chart", Bostock didn't save a reference to the
enter selection where he added the `<div>` bars. In the SVG example, he starts
with the `<g>` and saves the selection of all these elements, positioned along
the y-axis according to their order in the data set.

```javascript

var bar = chart.selectAll("g")
    .data(data)
  .enter().append("g")
    .attr("transform", function(d, i) {
        return "translate(0," + i * barHeight + ")";
    });
```

The `bar` variable now references the selection of `<g>` nodes. Each new chain
off this selection can add a new child element to each `<g>`, inheriting the
same datum as its parent.

```javascript
bar.append("rect")
    .attr("width", x)
    .attr("height", barHeight - 1);

bar.append("text")
    .attr("x", function(d) { return x(d) - 3; })
    .attr("y", barHeight / 2)
    .attr("dy", ".35em")
    .text(function(d) { return d; });
```

Part three of the bar chart tutorial introduces **ordinal scales**. In an
ordinal scale, the input data set takes one of a discrete set of values. Unless
we're mapping an ordinal variable to colors, the geometric parameters of SVG
elements need to be numerical. Setting up an ordinal scale is more involved than
a linear scale because there are simply more ways you might want to map a single
value to a range of numbers.

You can either be completely explicit:

```javascript
var x = d3.scale.ordinal()
    .domain(["A", "B", "C", "D", "E", "F"])
    .range([0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]);
```

Or use `rangeBands` or `rangePoints` to generate the output values for you from
a provided range. Bostock describes the differences between these:

> The rangeBands method computes range values so as to divide the chart area
> into evenly-spaced, evenly-sized bands, as in a bar chart. The similar
> rangePoints method computes evenly-spaced range values as in a scatterplot.

Each of these methods has a corresponding rounded version, which forces the
values to be nearest integers for the sake of pixel-kindness. Using these to try
and understand the difference between bands and points:

```javascript
var data = ["A", "B", "C", "D", "E", "F"],
	scale = d3.scale.ordinal() .domain(data);

_.map(data, scale.rangeRoundBands([0, 100])  // => [2, 18, 34, 50, 66, 82]
_.map(data, scale.rangeRoundPoints([0, 100]) // => [0, 20, 40, 60, 80, 100]
```


It really does come down to bands requiring some width, so the range is
subdivided into evenly-spaced regions. Points are assumed to not have width, so
the start and of the range can themselves be used for positioning data.

Part three also introduces axes, a convention for handling margins, and gives a
hat tip to the `ggplot` library for R.

### Mike Bostock: "Margin Convention"

([link][4])

This article lays out convention for adding specifying margins on a D3 graphic
that lets you customize them per-side and then mostly ignore margins in
subsequent calculations. At least if you're working with SVG lots where you can
wrap the entire plot in a `<g>` that handles the margins for you:

```javascript
var svg = d3.select("body").append("svg")
    .attr("width", width + margin.left + margin.right)
    .attr("height", height + margin.top + margin.bottom)
  .append("g")
    .attr("transform", "translate(" + margin.left + "," + margin.top + ")");
```

### Hadley Wickham: ggplot2 `geom_point` documentation 

([link][5])

Although `ggplot2` is higher level library (and, *I know*, for R and not the
web), there's some conceptual similarity between it and D3 that I think can help
illuminate the latter.

The anatomy of a simple scatter plot in ggplot, using R's built-in mtcars sample
data set, demonstrates some of the major building blocks:

```r
# Bind the mtcars dataset to the chart.
ggplot(mtcars) +
# Map each element of the dataset to a point, using the wt variable for the x
# position and the mpg variable for the y position.
	geom_point(aes(x = wt, y = mpg))
```

There are also pluggable scales in ggplot, although this example is using
implicit linear scales.


```javascript
svg.selectAll("circle")
    // Bind the mtcars dataset to the SVG.
	.data(mtcars)
	.enter()
        // Represent each observation with a point.
		.append("circle")
		.attr({
            // Use the wt variable for the x position.
			cx: function(d) { return x(d.wt); },
            // And the mpg variable for the y.
			cy: function(d) { return y(d.mpg); }
		});
```

ggplot is higher-level here primarily because it encapsulates the visual options
in its `geom_*` function, each of which represents a different layer you can add
on to the chart. D3 has no such nicety so that you work directly with DOM nodes
and SVG nodes.

### Mike Bostock: "General Update Pattern, I"

([link][6])

Bostock explains the different types of selection, using just text elements for
a barebones example. D3 binds data to DOM nodes by setting the datum as the
`__data__` property of the node. Whenever you call `data(dataset)` on a D3
selection, the provided dataset is matched up with the DOM nodes in the
selection. In the example, `text` is the _update selection_.

```javascript
var text = svg.selectAll("text").data(data);
```

A DOM node bound to a datum that is also present in the new dataset supplied
here is part of this selection. Any elements in `data` that aren't already bound
to the DOM go to `text.enter()`. Elements that were bound to a DOM node, but
aren't in `data` are returned in the `text.exit()` selection.

### Mike Bostock: "General Update Pattern, II"

([link][7])

When updating a selection with new data, D3 uses a _key function_ provided with
the data set to match up elements of the data set with the elements in the DOM
to compute the update, enter, and exit selections.

I cloned the  [gist][7a] for this article and modified the text selection to key
by index (the default behavior) to see how things break.

```diff
   var text = svg.selectAll("text")
-    .data(data, function(d) { return d; });
+    .data(data);
```

With this change, an element is included in the update selection only if the new
dataset also has an element in that position. Letters of the alphabet are
duplicated, along with other weird effects. It's worth [looking at][7b] with the
console open to get a better feel.

Transitions help make the role of the key function clear. Moral of the story: if
you're going to animate your data, you probably need to use a key function.
