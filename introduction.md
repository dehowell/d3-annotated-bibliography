D3: An Annotated Bibliography
=============================

Inspired by [Rob Friesel's][founddrama] [AngularJS annotated bibliography][ng-bib], I am collecting articles, books, etc. on [D3][d3] here, along with my commentary and summaries. I am finding D3 to have a steep learning curve, but that no other data graphics library for the web compares.

Leland Wilkinson, _The Grammar of Graphics_:

> There is also a practical reason for shunning chart typology. If we endeavor
> to develop a charting instead of a graphing program, we will accomplish two
> things. First, we inevitably will offer fewer charts than people want. Second,
> our package will have no deep structure. Our computer program will be
> unnecessarily copmlex, because we will fail to reuse objects or routines that
> function similary in different charts. And we will have no way to add new
> charts to our system without generating complex new code. Elegant design
> requires us to think about a theory of graphics, not charts.

Although D3 is a bit lower-level than what Wilkinson is describing, I think this
quote still illustrates the spirit of D3.
